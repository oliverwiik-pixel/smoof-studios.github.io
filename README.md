Your platform user ID (for example from Meta/Oculus) and an in-game/player identifier.

Optional: display name / username if you provide one (or if the platform provides it to the app).

Multiplayer/network data

Your IP address and approximate region (used for networking and security).

Session identifiers, matchmaking/lobby info, and connection diagnostics.

Gameplay and technical data

Basic gameplay events (e.g., settings, progression, session duration).

Crash logs and performance diagnostics (device/OS/app version).

Voice / chat

If your app has voice or chat: the content is transmitted to other players as part of gameplay. (Only include this section if you actually have it.)

How we use this information

Third-party services we use

We use third-party providers to run online features:

These providers may process information such as identifiers, IP address, and diagnostics to provide their services.

Sharing

We do not sell personal information. We share data only:

With the providers above to operate the App

If required by law, or to protect users and the service (fraud/abuse/security)

Data retention

We keep backend data only as long as needed for the App to work (e.g., account data, progress, moderation logs). If you request deletion, we will delete or anonymize data unless we must keep it for legal/security reasons.

We use reasonable safeguards to protect information, but no online service can be 100% secure.
